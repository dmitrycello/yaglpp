All examples in this section are dedicated to a widely popular tutorial [Learn Open GL](https://learnopengl.com/) by Joey de Vries. There are also some additional projects revealing interresting solutions using YAGL++ under [Misc](EXAMPLES.md#9-misc) category. The original source code of the tutorial, as well as all necessary resources can be found [here](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL). The **`Release / Win32 (EXE)`** version of executable compressed into _.7z_ file is added to every project folder for a demonstrational purpose. The present code uses application resources, allowing to create a portable executable file. The resources for every project must be placed into **`Common/res`** subfolder. Every executable file is supplied with an [gpu.ico](gpu.ico) icon, which must be copied into **`Common/res/icons`** subfolder. The present projects are using the [Precompiled header files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/creating-precompiled-header-files?view=msvc-170), accelerating the compilation process.
