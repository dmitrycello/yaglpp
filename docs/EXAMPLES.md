All examples in this section are dedicated to a widely popular tutorial [Learn Open GL 3.0](https://learnopengl.com/) by Joey de Vries. There are also some additional projects revealing interresting solutions using YAGL++ under **`misc`** category. The original source code of the tutorial, as well as all necessary resources can be found [here](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL). The **`Release / Win32 (EXE)`** version of executable compressed into _.7z_ file is added to every project folder for a demonstrational purpose. The present code uses application resources, allowing to create an independent portable executable file. The resources for every project must be placed into **`Common/res`** subfolder.

To create a project from the present code, use the YAGL++ project template created in a previous section. After project creation, copy all files exept a _.7z_ file, into the project directory. In the Solution Explorer add the _.h_ file(s) to the project _Header Files_ filter, add _.rc_ file to the _Resource Files_ filter, and finally a _.cpp_ file(s) to the _Source Files_ filter. It is safe to use offered project names, they won't conflict under the same YAGL++ solution.
